# Linear Regression
An implementation of simple linear regression 

## Data format
Both the training file and the test file should be text files, containing data in tabular format. Values should be separated by white space. With the EXCEPTION of the last column, the i-th row and j-th column contain a number, which should be the value for the j-th dimension of the i-th object. The LAST column stores a string, which should be the class label for each object.
