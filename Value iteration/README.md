# Value Iteration algorithmn
Implementation of value iteration algorithm in python 

## Steps to run 
1. Clone, fork, or download the repository 
2. Run the program using Python 

## Dataformat 
```
1.0,X
.,-1.0
```
- The value iteration algoritm works with the provided data format:
    - 1.0 is an starting node 
    - -1.0 is the goal node 
    - . is the empty space
    - X is an obstacle
